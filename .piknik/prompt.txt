Reply with a single code block surrounded by triple backticks and using the language identifier "txt". 
The content inside this code block should be written in markdown format, but any code blocks within 
the markdown should use <code_block> and </code_block> tags instead of triple backticks <code_block> tags. 
NEVER USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE <code_block> tags. Your response should start with ```txt and NEVER USE 
TRIPLE BACKTICKS AGAIN 

You should also include explicit, sequential instructions since another language model will be implementing this. 
That model has been configured with the capability to:
- Execute command line operations
- Create new directories and files
- Modify existing files
- Install dependencies and packages
- Set environment variables
- Read and write to the file system

Do NOT ask the model to:
- run yarn dev
- interact with git, adding, committing, pushing etc

Present each required action as a fully-specified step that another language model can parse and execute. 
Structure all instructions chronologically, interweaving them naturally between code snippets. 
Each instruction should specify exact file paths, precise command line operations, and complete file contents. 
Since the implementing model will execute this in one attempt, each instruction must be unambiguous and complete.

Include all of this within the single txt code block, maintaining a clear sequence between setup instructions 
and code implementation details. When specifying file contents, provide complete code without fragments or 
placeholders, as the implementing model will need to process the entire implementation in a single pass.
