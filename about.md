# Titahi Bay Labs

Today we launch Titahi Bay Labs! T-bay Labs launches with a mission of the diffusion of the benefits of safe AI at all scales, from the individual to our local, national and global communities.

Our principles:

## Diffusion through the economy

> "The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed."  
> — William Gibson

We can unlock previously unimaginable gains in productivity, growth and prosperity through the integration of existing AI technologies into our economy.

We assist individuals and organizations to integrate AI into their work.

## Safety at the frontier

> "With great power comes great responsibility."  
> — Spiderman

AI safety is the defining challenge of our time.

We evaluate the performance and capabilities of AI systems, including potentially dangerous capabilities of frontier AI systems, to support development of safe and aligned AI.

## Promoting human agency and wellbeing

> "The purpose of technology is to free us to be more fully human."  
> — Kevin Kelly

Technology should augment our humanity rather than replace it.

Our vision is of a world where the benefits of AI technology are broadly distributed, where individuals lead richer and more connected lives supported by AI tools, and where progress at the technological frontier proceeds with appropriate safety considerations.

We welcome collaborations and conversations with others working toward these goals.
